# DNA Analysis Tool

The DNA Analysis Tool is a simple bioinformatics tool that performs basic analysis on DNA sequences. It calculates the GC content, molecular weight, and reverse complement of a given DNA sequence. This tool provides a user-friendly interface built with PyQt5, making it easy to input sequences and obtain the analysis results.

## Features

- Calculate GC content of a DNA sequence
- Calculate molecular weight of a DNA sequence
- Compute the reverse complement of a DNA sequence

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Aganow/dna-analysis-tool.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd dna-analysis-tool
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

2. The DNA Analysis Tool window will open.

3. Enter a DNA sequence in the input field.

4. Click the "Analyze" button.

5. The results will be displayed in the corresponding fields.

6. Repeat the process for further analysis.
